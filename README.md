# Google Capstone Project
Google capstone project is a part of Google Advanced Data Analytics course which focuses on all the fundamentals of data science and machine learning.  

## Project Overview  
As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, you have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful.   

## Project Deliverables  
For this deliverable, you are asked to choose a method to approach this data challenge based on your prior course work. Select either a regression model or a tree-based machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the company. Both approaches are shown are valid and acceptable as long as they predict the employee's tenure.
